# Lanthanides

What are Lanthanides?
The lanthanides are generally considered to be elements with atomic numbers 58-71 (lanthanum to lutetium). The lanthanide series is the group of elements in which the 4f sublevel is being filled. All of these elements are metals (specifically, transition metals). They share several common properties.

However, there is some dispute over exactly where the lanthanides begin and end. Technically, either lanthanum or lutetium is a d-block element rather than f-block element. Yet, the two elements share characteristics with other elements in the group.

1) Attempting to cluster and categories the Lanthanides using PCA and k-means clustering.

2) Computing posterior distribution for the average 1st ionisation energy for the Lanthanides. Justifying the choice of prior and likelihood distributions and sampling of data points.
